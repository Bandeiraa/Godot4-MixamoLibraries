How to use Library files:

Drop in any mixamo rigged model, that was exported in the base pose
Re-import with the mixamo bone map.
Drop into scene, make local.
Open animation player, Animation > Manage Animations > Load Library > library.res
It's now mapped to the new character!

How to create library files:

On Mixamo:
Download the Ybot model, import to blender
Use YBot in mixamo to download all the animations you want
Default fbx for downlaods, no skin, animation 'in place' preferred.

In Blender:
Import base YBot
Import each animation fbx (in another collection for easy visiblity).
Open Nonlinear animation player
Name and push down Tpose for the main ybot armiture

In Nonlinear animation player, hit the 'N' key
A menu will appear on the right.
Click the drop down to select an animation from another armature
Name it's animation, click push down.
Repeat until all armatures are named and pushed to the base armature.
Delete all other armitures
Save, check scale, export as glb. placeholder materials to save space.

In Godot:
Bring .GLB into godot filesystem
Re-import, click "Skeleton3d", bone map drop down, load mixamo bone map.res.
Drop the .glb into the scene, transfom 0,0,0, make local, Save as scene.
Go to animation player, (test if you want that it works).
Click Animation > Manage Animations...
To the right of Global, click the save icon, save the library.

DONE library now exists.
