Lets build some animation libraries!

This Bot is CC0 (I made it just now), and the metarig/game rig is GPL 3.0 license
https://github.com/SAM-tak/BlenderGameRig

It is perfectly compatible with Godot's bone remapping and other game engines
and makes it ideal for creating open libraries of animations for sharing across
our characters.

If you build out any animations you'd like to share, please contribute here or
reach out.
