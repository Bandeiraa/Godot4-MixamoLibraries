Lets build some animation libraries!

The OpenBot and OpenDog models are CC0 (I made them just now), and the metarig/game rig is GPL 3.0 license from this project.
https://github.com/SAM-tak/BlenderGameRig

They should be perfectly compatible with Godot's bone remapping features and aregreat for creating open libraries of animations for sharing across
our characters and animals.

You can map the metarig bones to any character you make, and then in godot, use the OpenBot map when reimporting.
The skeleton can then adopt the .res libraries.

If you want to build out your own animations, use the .blend file, you can make animations on the openbots using the control rig in pose mode.
Those animations in godot we can turn into a library to reuse on any model.
