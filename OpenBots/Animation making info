Lets build some animation libraries!

The OpenBot and OpenDog models are CC0 (I made them just now), and the metarig/game rig is GPL 3.0 license from this project.

They should be perfectly compatible with Godot's bone remapping features and aregreat for creating open libraries of animations for sharing across
our characters and animals.

If you build out any animations you'd like to share, please contribute here or
reach out.
